Network Health Predictor:-

WORKING-UAA platform collects data from Performace & Alarm Data(EMS),NE Specific 
        Output(CLI),Topology Data and this sends data to NHP and this NHP 
        sends that data to Blue Planet BigData Cluster.Here GPUBased modelling
        and ML Training Servers,BP Data Science add modesl tuned and refined 
        and set which AI/ML algorithm is correct for data those are again 
        pushed to NHP.
          This data fromNHP sent to Performance of Network Anomomlies.It is
        divided into Swagger API,UAA UI.
            In Swagger API has OSS/BSS and Ticketing systems
            In UAA UI it has Customer Engineering and Operations

-->Architecture
   >HYPERSCALE ARCHITECTURE:-
       Modular ultra-scalableclustering technology
       Virtual and physical server deployments
       On demand capacity expansion by adding instances
                Mediation Server
                Shard Database Server
                Client Server
       Application Server
                Single instance


-->Angular Client
      Hosts the web based UI Framework
      Single Instancessupports 25 concurrent users
      Provide Business Dashboards
      Provide Role Based Acess Control
      Abality to integrate with external authentication(LDAP,TACACS+)

>HTTP client is basically called as angular client server
>Working and MODEL:-
  It has Load Balancer which balances users across servers
  Load Balancer is connected to UI FRAMEWORK,it consists of client servers 1 to N
  It has RBAC aslo.RBAC,UI FRAMEWORK are in one level.
  Graph Database works on topology,Application server works on Reports,charts data
  Graph Database,Application server conneccted to UI Framework,RBAC both in one 
  block

-->Application Server:-
     Centralized server-Single Instance
     Performs Core Processing Functions
     Communicates System Changes to Nediation Server
     Hosts the Reporting Engine
     Performs all Fault Automation Functions


It has three levels:
In first level it consists oftwo components connected each oother side by side
 Client(Web UI)and Graph Database.
These both are connected to second level Application Server.
 It has workflow,correlation,Alarms/Events,Reports,Web services API,Suppression
In level 3 it has two components Master Database Server(Master DB),Med Serve(1-N)
  These both handles Data queries,Events & Configuration Data.
In each and every level data flow in two ways


-->DataBase server:
>Distributed Persistance
>Master Database
    Provides entry single point for all data queries though data is distributed 
       in shards.
    Holds inventory and fault data
    Distributes configuration data to shards
>Graph-Single Instance
     Netwrok Inventory and Relationships
     Data source for topology visualization
>Shards-Multiple Instances
     Drivern by data processing
     Performs Baseline
     Holds Performance Data
     Mediation servers push performance data to shards

-->MEDIATION SERVER:
>Distributed-MMultiple Instances
>Mediateswith network elements
>Collects and normalize the data
>Number of Mediation Servers depend on
     Number of end points
         250k objects
     Data Collection frequency
     Number of Metrics

WORKING & STRUCTURE:
It has Application Server,Mediation Server,Shard server,Carrier Network
Mediation Server has Discovery,Data Collection,Smart Plugins,Connection Mgmt
 Synchronization.It is connected toShard server,carrier network.
Application server sends events & inventoy data
Shard server sends metrics data
Carrier Networks sends events and metrics



--In mediation server it has JBOSS,Kafka server(longevents,snmp trap)
--Node sends Traps to the Kafka SNMP connector on anyof mediation server
--Kafka SNMP connector listen on port 162 and collects ,converts SNMP Trap 
   PDU's into event objects.SNMP Trap sends to Kafka Snmp Connector.
   logevents sends to logtash collector.
--Kafka consumer fromall the mediation servers read the snmp event but
  only the mediation server which manages the corresponding node forwards
  the Trap event for processing
--Mediation server forwards the SNMP Trap event to SNMP Adaptor


-->Open Platform:
>Leverages modern open source technologies
>Highly-available,geographially diverse,and tertiary configurations
>Virtualand physical server deployments
>Operating Systems Supported
   CentOS 6,7
   RHEL6,7
>Database 
    MariaDB v10.0
>Syslog/Log Receiver
    Logstash
>Graph Database
    Neo4j 3.2
>UI Technologies
    D3.js
    Bootstrap.js
    Angular/Node.js

-->System Patches or Upgrades
>Plug-ins are hot-swappable(no downtime)
>Updated plug-ins are backward compatible through previous versions
>New  plug-ins takes effect after download with no loss of data
>SystemPatches require downtime,usually 30-60 mins

                       RESOURCE ADAPTERS


RESOURCE APAPTERS:It collects and stores data along with that.
It aslo collect Physical,Logical inventory that has Cards,Port Descriptions,
 Ports,Logical Ports,Provision Speed info and store,collect regularly.

-->LAUNCH OSS/BSS Integrations:
 >DevOps Ready:
     Swagger based REST API
     Integrate to a varietyof external systems including: Trouble Ticketing
